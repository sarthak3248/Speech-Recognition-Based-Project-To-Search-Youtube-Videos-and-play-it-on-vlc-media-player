# Speech-Recognition-Based-Project-To-Search-Youtube-Videos-and-play-it-on-vlc-media-player
The Following project is based upon Speech Recognition and its application in real World.


The Following Modules need to be installed using a pip command:
pip install SpeechRecognition(To convert Speech into Text)
pip install beautifulsoup4(Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files)
pip install python-vlc(For playing videos on vlc player)
pip install PyAudio(For microphone usage)

Speech Input Using a Microphone and Translation of Speech to Text

Allow Adjusting for Ambient Noise: Since the surrounding noise varies, we must allow the program a second or too to adjust the energy threshold of recording so it is adjusted according to the external noise level.
Speech to text translation: This is done with the help of Google Speech Recognition. 
This requires an active internet connection to work.
However, there are certain offline Recognition systems such as PocketSphinx, but have a very rigorous installation process that requires several dependencies.
Google Speech Recognition is one of the easiest to use.
